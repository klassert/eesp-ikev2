Internet-Draft           EESP IKEv2 negotiation            February 2025


1.  Introduction

   The Enhanced Encapsulating Security Payload (EESP), specified in
   [I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp], introduces enhancements to the
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) defined in [RFC4303].  These
   improvements address evolving requirements in modern IPsec
   deployments.  EESP offers increased flexibility for hardware offloads
   at the packet level.  It supports carrying inner packet flow
   identifiers for the use with ECMP, RSS hardware, and IPsec peers
   prior to decryption.  EESP also enables the establishment of Sub
   Child SAs with independent sequence number spaces.  Additionally, it
   supports the use of 64-bit sequence numbers in each packet or the
   omission of sequence numbers when the Replay Protection service is
   disabled.  EESP packets carry a version number, enabling easier
   support for future extensions.

   This document specifies the negotiation of EESP Security Associations
   (SAs) within the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
   protocol [RFC7296].  It details the creation, rekeying, and deletion
   of EESP SAs, as well as the negotiation of EESP specific transform
   properties and properties.

   The extensions defined here enable EESP SAs to coexist with ESP SAs
   in stateful decryption configurations, while introducing new
   capabilities to enhance IPsec’s performance and versatility in modern
   use cases.

   EESP Sub SA is a single unidirectional, outgoing, SA derived from a
   pair Child SAs negotiated using IKEv2.  Each Sub SA derive its own
   unique encryption key and maintain independent sequence number
   spaces, and IV spaces from an existing Child SA, Sub SAs streamline
   traffic flow management, reduce overhead, and enable more efficient
   lifecycle operations.

   This document does not obsolete or update any existing RFCs.  While
   stateless implementations of EESP are referenced, their negotiation,
   which is similar to [PSP], is outside the scope of this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   It is assumed that readers are familiar with the IKEv2 negotiation
   [RFC7296], IPsec architecture [RFC4301] and ESP [RFC4303].  This
   document uses a notation and conventions from IKEv2 [RFC7296] to
   negotiate EESP.

   This document uses the following terms defined in IKEv2 [RFC7296]:
   Child SA, CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, IKE_AUTH exchange,
   USE_TRANSPORT_MODE

   This document uses the following terms defined in [PSP]: PSP (a
   recursive acronym for PSP Security Protocol), Network Identifier
   (VNI), Crypt Offset.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC2992]: Equal-
   cost multi-path (ECMP)

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC4303]:
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.mrossberg-ipsecme-multiple-sequence-counters]: Sub-Child SA.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-rename-esn] : Replay Protection.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2]: Sender-ID, Data-Security SA,
   GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS, GCKS policy.

2.  EESP SA IKEv2 Negotiation

   To negotiate of EESP Security Associations (SAs), as specified in
   [I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp].  Propose 'Protocol ID' EESP input SA
   Payload, Proposal payload.  These extensions provide the ability to
   establish EESP SAs using the IKE_AUTH or the CREATE_CHILD_SA
   exchanges.  The initiator includes EESP-specific transforms and
   attributes in the proposal, allowing the responder to evaluate and
   establish the SA if supported.

   IKEv2 Notify Message Status Type USE_WESP_MODE, [RFC5840], is not
   supported when negotiating EESP SA.  As the WESP functionality is
   part of EESP protocol.  If this notification is received it MUST be
   discarded.

Internet-Draft           EESP IKEv2 negotiation            February 2025


   The ESP_TFC_PADDING_NOT_SUPPORTED, [RFC7296], notification is not
   supported in EESP, instead use IP-TFS, USE_AGGFRAG, [RFC9347].  If
   this notification is received it MUST be discarded.

2.1.  Negotiating an EESP SA using IKE_AUTH or CREATE_CHILD_SA

   To negotiate an EESP Child SA, use the IKEv2 IKE_AUTH or
   CREATE_CHILD_SA new SA exchange.  The SA Payload, Proposal MUST have
   Security Protocol Identifier, Proto Id = EESP which is specified in
   [I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp], as specified in this document, and uses
   the EESP Transform attributes defined in Section 3.

2.2.  Rekeying an EESP SA with the CREATE_CHILD_SA Exchange

   Rekeying an EESP SA follows the same procedure as rekeying an ESP SA,
   as specified in Sections 1.3.3 and 2.8 of [RFC7296].  During the
   rekeying process, the Section 3 MUST remain identical to those
   negotiated when the SA was initially established.

2.3.  Deleting EESP SA with INFORMATIONAL Exchange

   EESP SA always exist in pairs.  Deleting EESP SA follows the same
   procedure as deleting Child SA using IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange as
   specified in Section 1.4.1 [RFC7296]

3.  EESP SA Transforms

   EESP introduces several transform properties that are negotiated
   during the establishment of an EESP SA.  These properties MUST be
   identical for the duration of the SA.  When the SA is rekeyed, the
   new SA MUST inherit all EESP transform properties negotiated for the
   original EESP SA.

                         Figure 1: EESP SA proposal

3.1.  Replay Protection Service

   EESP provides an optional Replay service using 64-bit sequence
   numbers carried in the packet.  To enable Replay service the
   initiator SHOULD propose Sequence Numbers Transforms, SN = (64-bit
   Sequential Numbers) in the Proposal Substructure inside the Security
   Association (SA) payload in the IKEv2 Exchange.  When the responder
   selects 64-bit Sequential Numbers, a both sides MUST enable Reply
   Protection.

   To disable sequence numbering, and thus replay protection based on
   sequence numbers, the initiator MUST propose SN=None (TBD10).  When
   the sequence numbers are disabled, there won't be any SN in the EESP
   packet, the receiver SHOULD NOT dynamically modify ports or addresses
   without using IKEv2 Mobility [RFC4555].

   Because the Replay Protection service is disabled, an attacker can re
   play packets with a different source address.  Such an attacker could
   disrupt the connection by replaying a single packet with a different
   source address or port number.

3.2.  Explicit Initialization Vector

   If the algorithm used to encrypt the payload requires cryptographic
   synchronization data, e.g., an Initialization Vector (IV), then this
   may be carried explicitly in every EESP packet.

3.3.  Implicit Initialization Vectors

   With the Implicit Initialization Vector (IIV) encryption algorithm,
   as specified in [RFC8750], the IV MUST be omitted in the EESP packet.
   To enable this functionality, IIV transforms defined in [IKEv2-Enc]
   MUST be used during negotiation.  Furthermore, the [IKEv2-SN]
   extension MUST be negotiated to support the use of 64-bit Sequential
   Numbers in EESP packets.  If the the proposal does not include 64-bit

   Sequential Numbers return error NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.

3.4.  EESP Version

   Each EESP packets carry EESP Base Header version, which is specified
   [I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp].  This SHOULD BE negotiated using IKEv2.
   Each Base Header version, to be able to negotiate via IKEv2, SHOULD
   have a corresponding 'IKEv2 Security Protocol Identifiers' The
   initial version sepecified EESPv0(TBD1)

4.  Sub SA

   Existing mechanisms for establishing Child SAs, as described in
   [RFC7296], yield pair of SAs.  High-speed IP traffic is often
   asymmetric.  Creating multiple pairs of Child SAs, e.g. [RFC9611] or
   for DSCP to carry asymetric traffic is inefficient.  A pair of Child
   SA combined with multiple unidirectional a set of Sub SAs with Sub SA
   IDs greater than 0, provides a more flexible approach to carrying
   asymmetric traffic patterns, particularly in high-speed environments.
   Sub SAs reduces overhead, improves resource utilization, and enhances
   scalability for large-scale deployments.  In many use cases, several
   uni directinal SAs utilized, while others are unused which can result
   in unnecessary overhead for management, rekeying, and resource
   consumption.  Furthermore, using multiple bidirectional Child SAs for
   granular traffic flows often leads to additional setup delays and
   complex lifetime management.  This inefficiency is particularly acute
   in high-throughput or low-latency environments, where rapid setup and
   teardown of SAs is essential to maintain performance.

   An EESP Sub SA provides a unidirectional Security Association derived
   from an existing EESP Child SA pair.  It inherits all of the Child
   SA’s properties except for keys, sequence number space, and IV space,
   each of which MUST be unique to each Sub SA.  By defining these
   unidirectional flows, Sub SAs offer a more efficient alternative to
   large numbers of bidirectional Child SAs with the same traffic
   selectors [RFC7296], [RFC9611].

   Each Sub SA is identified by a Sub SA ID, which MUST be carried in
   each EESP packet in the Session ID field—consistent with the
   negotiation of the EESP Child SA.  This Sub SA ID is used to derive a
   unique key, yielding the following benefits:

   *  Unidirectional Operation: In contrast to the per-resource SAs of
      [RFC9611], which are bidirectional, Sub SAs MAY be defined
      strictly in one direction when reverse traffic is absent.
      CREATE_CHILD_SA does not otherwise support unidirectional SAs.

Internet-Draft           EESP IKEv2 negotiation            February 2025


   *  Zero Additional Setup Time: Sub SAs require no extra IKE message
      exchanges, unlike requesting more Child SAs or relying on large
      IKE windows [RFC7296].  This allows rapid provisioning of extra
      flows without introducing round-trip delays.

   *  Simplified Lifecycle Management**: Sub SAs are more efficient to
      create, rekey, and delete than traditional Child SAs.  Their
      narrow scope streamlines both key management and policy
      enforcement.

   *  On-the-Fly Key Derivation: Implementations using hierarchical key
      derivation, particularly with hardware offload, MAY derive Sub SA
      keys dynamically on a per-packet basis.  This mitigates the risk
      of data-plane performance degradation caused by a large number of
      keys [I-D.ponchon-ipsecme-anti-replay-subspaces].

   AEAD transforms such as AES-GCM [RFC4106], [RFC8750] require that the
   IV never repeat within a single Sub SA.  Because each Sub SA uses a
   distinct key, the IV MAY be reused across different Sub SAs,
   satisfying the requirement that each key be paired with a unique IV.
   Implementations MUST also maintain an independent sequence number
   space for each Sub SA when full 64-bit sequence numbers are in use.
   For a given Sub SA key, sequence numbers MUST remain unique and
   monotonically increasing to meet cryptographic requirements.

4.1.  Negotiation of Sub SAs

   Sub SAs are negotiated during the creation of an EESP Child SA, such
   as in the IKE_AUTH or CREATE_CHILD_SA new SA exchanges.  To propose
   Sub SA support, the initiator MUST include a USE_EESP_SUB_SA
   notification, which specifies the "Minimum Number of Sub SAs" that it
   supports.

   If the responder accepts the request, it MUST include a
   USE_EESP_SUB_SA notification in the response, specifying the "Maximum
   Number of Sub SAs" it supports.  The negotiated number of Sub SAs for
   the Child SA MUST be the minimum value between these two numbers.

   Both peers MUST ensure that the number of Sub SAs established
   complies with the negotiated limit.  If at any point a peer attempts
   to exceed the agreed number, the implementation MUST reject such an
   attempt and log an appropriate error.

   If the response does not include USE_EESP_SUB_SA or the responder
   indicates a lower "Maximum Number of Sub SAs" than proposed, the
   initiator MAY delete the Child SA.

   *  Minimum number of Sub SAs (2 octets).  MUST be greater than 0, If
      0 is received, it MUST be interpreted as 1.

4.2.  UDP Encapsulation of Sub SA

   An EESP SA primarily uses UDP encapsulation to facilitate NAT
   traversal.  However, an additional use case for UDP encapsulation is
   to introduce source port entropy, which supports ECMP or/and RSS
   (Receive Side Scaling) mechanisms.  In such scenarios, the initiator
   MAY also use a distinct, ephemeral source port for Sub SA IDs greater
   than zero.  Both peers MAY independently select different source
   ports for the same Sub SA ID.

   It is important to note that IKE messages MUST NOT utilize these
   ephemeral source ports.  Instead, IKE traffic should be confined to
   the source and destination ports to ensure proper protocol operation
   and maintain compatibility with existing implementations.

   When using ephemeral source ports, the receiver can only set the
   source port upon arrival of an EESP packet with that Sub SA ID.  If
   the receiver is pre-populating a Sub SA, it may have to install it
   with a source port set to zero and, upon arrival of a packet, update
   the source port using a mapping change.

   Additionally, when multiple Sub SAs exist, the receiver SHOULD
   maintain a mapping table to track the source port associated with
   each Sub SA independently.  This ensures that traffic is correctly
   routed and prevents ambiguity in handling packets associated with
   different Sub SAs when a NAT is present.

4.3.  Key derivation for Sub SA

   When the EESP SA is negotiated with a Sub SA Keys (SUB_SA_ID), each
   Sub SA derives its own unique keys.  This allows each Sub SA its own
   independent Sequence Number space, and independent IV space.

   The requirements:

   *  Independent keys for each Sub SA

   *  Ability to derive Sub SA keys on the fly with least amount of
      memory usage

   *  Minimal memory requirements

   *  Keyderviation support multiple SAs, such as EESP, AH

   *  Use the same Crypto primitive as used for encryption e.g. AES-*

4.3.1.  Hierarchical key derivation

   Hierarchical key derivation use Sub SA ID, which is carried in EESP
   Seesion ID or in EESP Flow ID(TLV), as an input to the key
   dervivation.

   Section 2.17 [RFC7296] specifies a KEYMAT derivation.  The KEYMAT is
   split into

   SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei, SK_er.  Each of these keys MUST be used as
   master key to derive further Sub SA specific key.

   SK_S_xx = prf+(prf+(SK_xx,Sub SA ID))

   for e.g. SK_S_ei = prf+(prf+(SK_ei, Sub SA ID))

   The Sub SA keys can be derived in ESP sub system or in IKE sub system
   when pre installing all SAs and keys.

   One advantage of Hierarchical KDF is the Sub SA keys MAY BE generated
   on the fly, for every packet, when available fast memory is limited,
   for example [PSP].  This is usually the case when key derivation is
   implemented in hardware.  When implimenting in hardware choose a
   hardware friendly prf+.

4.4.  Rekey Key Derivation.

   During the EESP SA rekey, a new KEYMAT is derived using the new Ni
   and Nr values.  If a Key Exchange (KE) method was used in the
   rekying, CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, the new key MAY also include g^ir
   as part of the derivation process.

   Even though each Sub SA can be independently rekeyed, for simplicity,
   all Sub SAs MUST be rekeyed together when either a cryptographic
   limit or a time-based limit is reached.

   The time-based limit, also described in Section 2.8 of [RFC7296],
   ensures periodic key replacement to minimize the risks associated
   with long-term key exposure, even if the cryptographic limit has not
   been reached.

   When rekeying is triggered for any of the Sub SA by whichever
   limit—cryptographic or time- based—is reached first, subseqenty all
   Sub SAs must rekeyed.

4.5.  Multiple Sender Group SA Key Derivation

   When using EESP with a group SA, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2], the Sender-ID MUST be used for deriving a
   unique key for each sender.  This ensures that each sender maintains
   a distinct IV and/or sequence number space.  When using independent
   keys, the Implicit IV (IIV) transforms may be used.

   The Sender-ID is carried in each packet within the Session ID field,
   allowing efficient and reliable key differentiation for data security
   and integrity.

   The maximum length of GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS in GCKS policy is 16 bits
   when using the Session ID to carry the Sender-ID.

   [Note: we could allow 32 bit or any lenght field for
   GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS then it would have be carried in a EESP Options
   TLV and not in Session ID]

5.  Session ID

   The Session ID is a multi-purpose attribute with mutually exclusive
   values.  The initiator MUST propose a single value in the Child SA
   proposal, Transform EESPSSID (Value).  The responder MUST either
   accept the proposed value or reject it with an INVALID_SESSION_ID
   error message, indicating a supported value.

6.  UDP Encapsulation for EESP

   UDP encapsulation for EESP is largely similar to the ESP UDP
   encapsulation specified in [RFC3948], with the primary difference
   being the UDP source port used by the EESP Sub SA may be different
   from IKE_SA source port, as specified in [RFC3947], for more flexible
   handling of EESP traffic, particularly ECMP support along the path
   and in the NIC.

   A receiver indenting to support both ESP and EESP encapsulated in UDP
   must start ESP SPI, most significant bit of the SPI, with zero.

7.  EESP Crypt Offset Option

   This option is typically used for within one Datacenter use case such
   as [PSP].  To negotiate, the initiator sends USE_CRYPTOFFSET together
   with USE_TRANSPORT_MODE and the responder respond with the same.
   USE_EESP_CRYPTOFFSET is not supported in Tunnel mode or BEET mode.

   'NOTE' Add EESP draft UDP section reference.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Changes in the Existing IKEv2 Registries

8.1.1.  IKEv2 Security Protocol Identifiers registry

   This document defines new Protocol ID in the "IKEv2 Security Protocol
   Identifiers" registry, [IKEv2-SP]:

               +=============+==========+=================+
               | Protocol ID | Protocol | Reference       |
               +=============+==========+=================+

                                 Table 2

8.1.2.  IKEv2 Notify Message Status Types registry.

         +=======+============================+=================+
         | Value | Notify Message Status Type | Reference       |

8.1.3.  Extending ESP with EESP

   Several tables in [IKEv2-IANA] that specify ESP as protocol should be
   extended with EESP.  Should we list each table one by one or specify
   as replace ESP, with ESP, EESP.e.g in the Transform Type Values,
   replace 'IKE and ESP' with 'IKE, ESP, and EESP'

   Changes the "Used In" column for the existing allocations as follows;

8.1.4.  Sequence Number

   This document defines a new value in the IKEv2 "Transform Type 5 -
   Sequence Numbers Properties Transform IDs" registry:

         +=========+===========================+=================+
         | Value   | Name                      | Reference       |
         +=========+===========================+=================+

         | [TBD10] | None                      | [this document] |
         +---------+---------------------------+-----------------+

9.  Implementation Status

   [Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Authors are requested to add a note to the RFC Editor at the top of
   this section, advising the Editor to remove the entire section before
   publication, as well as the reference to [RFC7942].

10.  Security Considerations

   EESP option Crypt Offset [I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp] section [XXX]
   allows exposing transport headers for telemetry.  It is indented use
   of within data center.

   When an EESP receiver implementation uses Stateless Decryption, it
   may not rely on single Security Policy Database (SPD) as specified in
   the IPsec Architecture document [RFC4301], section 4.4.1.  However,
   the receiver MUST validate the negotiated Security Policy through
   other means to ensure compliance with the intended security
   requirements.  For by adding Security Policy to the socket or route
   entry.  Also comply with ICMP processing specified in section 6 of
   RFC4301.

   Additional security relevant aspects of using the IPsec protocol are
   discussed in the Security Architecture document [RFC4301]
