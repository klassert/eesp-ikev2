#+begin_abstract
This document specfies how to negotiate the use of the Enhanced
Encapsulating Security Payload (EESP) protocol using the Internet Key
Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2). The EESP protocol, which is
defined in draft-klassert-ipsecme-eesp, provides the same security
services as Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), but has richer
functionality and provides better performance in specific
circumstances. This document specifies negotiation of version 0 of
EESP.

* Introduction

The Enhanced Encapsulating Security Payload (EESP), specified in
[[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]], introduces enhancements to the
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) defined in [RFC4303]. These
improvements address evolving requirements in modern IPsec
deployments. EESP offers increased flexibility for hardware
offloads at the packet level. It supports carrying inner packet flow
identifiers for the use with ECMP, RSS hardware, and IPsec peers
prior to decryption. EESP also enables the establishment of Sub SAs
with independent keys and sequence number spaces. Additionally, it
supports the use of 64-bit sequence numbers transmitted in each
packet or the omission of sequence numbers when the Replay Protection
service is not needed. EESP packets carry a version number, enabling
easier support for future extensions.

This document specifies the negotiation of EESP Security
Associations (SAs) within the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol [RFC7296]. It details the creation,
rekeying, and deletion of EESP SAs, as well as the negotiation of
EESP specific transforms and properties.

The extensions defined here enables EESP SAs to coexist with ESP SAs,
while introducing new capabilities to enhance IPsec's performance
and versatility in modern use cases.

This document does not obsolete or update any existing RFCs. While
stateless implementations of EESP are referenced, their negotiation,
which is similar to [[PSP]], is outside the scope of this document.

** Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

** Terminology
It is assumed that readers are familiar with IKEv2
[[RFC7296]], IPsec architecture [[RFC4301]] and ESP [[RFC4303]].
This document uses a notation and conventions from IKEv2 [RFC7296].

# [VS] Well, this list is for sure not complete
# [VS] We also use "a lot" from RFC 7296, perhaps no need to
# [VS] emphasize these particular terms
# [VS] I'd rather to delete this, above we assume that readers are
# [VS] familiar with IKEv2 # This document uses the following terms
# [VS] defined in IKEv2 [[RFC7296]]:
# Child SA, CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, IKE_AUTH exchange,
# USE_TRANSPORT_MODE

# [VS] I wonder whether we need to reference PSP for this
# [VS] If we do, then PSP should be a normative reference
# [VS] I think we'd rather to avoid this and re-define these things
# [VS] here. BTW, VNI is not used in the text
# This document uses the following terms defined in [[PSP]]: PSP (a
# recursive acronym for PSP Security Protocol), Network Identifier
# (VNI), Crypt Offset.

This document uses the following terms defined in [[RFC2992]]:
Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP)

# [VS] Again, the above we mentioned that readers should be familiar
# [VS] with ESP. Is there a need to repeat it?
# This document uses the following terms defined in [[RFC4303]]:
# Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).

# [VS] See note above. This should either be a normative reference
# [VS] And we use a different term - Sub SA. "Sub-Child SA" is not
# [VS] used in the text. I'd rather to delete this
# This document uses the following terms defined in
# [[I-D.mrossberg-ipsecme-multiple-sequence-counters]]: Sub-Child SA.

# [VS] This is the name of transform, I don't think we should
# [VS] reference ikev2-rename-esn here
# [VS] ikev2-rename-esn is only relevant *now* until it becomes an
# [VS] RFC and IANA updates IKEv2 registries
# [VS] For this reason it is referenced in G-IKEv2 draft, which uses
# [VS] not-yet-assigned name for this transform
# [VS] But by the time this draft would be published, the
# [VS] ikev2-rename-esn will most probably become an RFC and IANA
# [VS] completes the renaming,
# [VS] thus we can just reference the IANA registry
# This document uses the following terms defined in
# [[I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-rename-esn]] : Replay Protection.

# [VS] I'd rather to put off all the group SA stuff
# This document uses the following terms defined in
# [[I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2]]: Sender-ID, Data-Security SA,
# GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS, GCKS policy.

* EESP Overview

** EESP Version

Each EESP packet carries the EESP Base Header version, which is
specified in Section [XXX] of [[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]]. EESP
version determines the format of the EESP packet and its processing
rules. The initial version specified in
[[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]] is version 0.

** EESP Sub SA
Existing mechanisms for establishing Child SAs, as described in
[[RFC7296]], yield pair of SAs. High-speed IP traffic is often
asymmetric. Creating multiple pairs of Child SAs, e.g. for multiple
resources ([[RFC9611]]), or for DSCP to carry asymmetric traffic,
is inefficient.

To deal with this limitations EESP introduces the concept of Sub SAs.
An EESP Sub SA is an unidirectional SA derived from
the same-direction EESP SA of the pair of SAs negotiated using
IKEv2. Each Sub SA derives its own keying material and
maintains independent sequence number spaces and IV spaces from the
parent Child SA; all other characteristics of Sub SAs (algorithms,
traffic selectors etc.) are identical to the EESP SA they belong to.

Each Sub SA is identified by a Sub SA Id, which is a number in the
range from zero up to the maximum Sub SA ID indicated by the
receiver of the Sub SA during EESP SA negotiation via IKEv2 (see
[[Announcing Maximum Sub SA ID]]). The Sub SA ID is carried
in the Session ID field of the EESP base header (see Section [XXX] of
[[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]]). The Sub SA ID MUST be unique for
all Sub SAs in the context of an EESP SA.

# [VS] perhaps some words should be added about other fields where
# [VS] Sub SA ID can be transmitted. But this is not very clear for
# [VS] me right now.

If a peer receives an EESP packet with a Sub SA ID greater than the
maximum value it announced during EESP SA setup, that peer MAY drop
this packet without further processing.

Use of Sub SAs is optional in EESP and can be negotiated using IKEv2.

# [VS] I think that the text below should be in the core EESP draft
# [VS] The concept of EESP Sub SAs is not specific to IKEv2
# [VS] negotiation, I don't think we should elaborate this concept
# here in details, just a few words and the way they are negotiated

# Sub SAs can be created "on the fly" within the kernel
# IPsec subsystem. Sub SAs streamline traffic flow management, reduce
# overhead, and enable more efficient lifecycle operations.

# A pair of EESP SAs combined with multiple unidirectional Sub
# SAs, provides a more flexible approach to carrying
# asymmetric traffic patterns, particularly in high-speed environments.
# Sub SAs reduces overhead, improves resource utilization, and enhances
# scalability for large-scale deployments. In many use cases, several
# uni directinal SAs utilized, while others are unused which can result
# in unnecessary overhead for management, rekeying, and resource
# consumption. Furthermore, using multiple bidirectional Child SAs for
# granular traffic flows often leads to additional setup delays and
# complex lifetime management. This inefficiency is particularly acute
# in high-throughput or low-latency environments, where rapid setup and
# teardown of SAs is essential to maintain performance.
#
# Each Sub SA is identified by a Sub SA ID, which MUST be carried in
# each EESP packet in the Session ID field—consistent with the
# negotiation of the EESP Child SA. This Sub SA ID is used to derive a
# unique key, yielding the following benefits:
#
# - Unidirectional Operation: In contrast to the per-resource
#   SAs of [[RFC9611]], which are bidirectional, Sub SAs MAY be
#   defined strictly in one direction when reverse traffic is
#   absent. CREATE_CHILD_SA does not otherwise support
#   unidirectional SAs.
#
# - Zero Additional Setup Time: Sub SAs require no extra IKE
#   message exchanges, unlike requesting more Child SAs or relying
#   on large IKE windows [[RFC7296]]. This allows rapid provisioning
#   of extra flows without introducing round-trip delays.
#
# - Simplified Lifecycle Management**: Sub SAs are more efficient
#   to create, rekey, and delete than traditional Child SAs. Their
#   narrow scope streamlines both key management and policy
#   enforcement.
#
# - On-the-Fly Key Derivation: Implementations using hierarchical
#   key derivation, particularly with hardware offload, MAY derive
#   Sub SA keys dynamically on a per-packet basis. This mitigates
#   the risk of data-plane performance degradation caused by a large
#   number of keys [[I-D.ponchon-ipsecme-anti-replay-subspaces]].
#
# AEAD transforms such as AES-GCM [[RFC4106]], [[RFC8750]] require
# that the IV never repeat within a single Sub SA. Because each
# Sub SA uses a distinct key, the IV MAY be reused across different
# Sub SAs, satisfying the requirement that each key be paired with a
# unique IV. Implementations MUST also maintain an independent
# sequence number space for each Sub SA when full 64-bit sequence
# numbers are in use. For a given Sub SA key, sequence numbers MUST
# remain unique and monotonically increasing to meet cryptographic
# requirements.

** EESP Sequence Numbers

Unlike ESP, EESPv0 header allows to transmit 64-bit sequence numbers.
In addition, the Sequence Number field in the EESPv0 header is
optional and can be omitted from the packet if replay protection
service is not needed. Note that while possible, disabling the
replay protection service is generally NOT RECOMMENDED and should
only be done if the upper level protocol provides this service. See
[[Security Considerations]] for details.

# [VS] I believe this is covered below in the discssion about
# [VS] restrictions on negotiated parameters

#  ** Explicit Initialization Vector
#
# If the algorithm used to encrypt the payload requires cryptographic
# synchronization data, e.g., an Initialization Vector (IV), then this
# may be carried explicitly in every EESP packet.
#
# ** Implicit Initialization Vectors
#
# With the Implicit Initialization Vector (IIV) encryption algorithm,
# as specified in [[RFC8750]], the IV MUST be omitted in the EESP
# packet. To enable this functionality, IIV transforms defined in
# [[IKEv2-Enc]] MUST be used during negotiation. Furthermore,
# the [[IKEv2-SN]] extension MUST be negotiated to support the use of
# 64-bit Sequential Numbers in EESP packets. If the the proposal
# does not include 64-bit Sequential Numbers return error
# NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.

# [VS] What is this section about? How it relates to IKEv2?
# [VS] It should be part of the core EESP draft...

# ** Session ID
#
# The Session ID is a multi-purpose attribute with mutually
# exclusive values.

# [VS] From my recollection of the discussion during the last call,
# [VS] we decided that Cryp Offset is carried in the EESP header and
# [VS] there is no need to negotiate it. Correct me if I'm wrong, for
# [VS] now I'd rather delete the related text

# * EESP Crypt Offset Option
# This option is typically used for within one Datacenter use case
# such as [[PSP]]. To negotiate, the initiator sends USE_CRYPTOFFSET
# together with USE_TRANSPORT_MODE and the responder respond with the
# same. USE_EESP_CRYPTOFFSET is not supported in Tunnel mode or BEET
# mode.
# Note STK: This needs discussion

* EESP SA Negotiation in IKEv2

Current EESP specification [[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]] defines
version 0 of the EESP protocol. Consequently, this document limits
its scope to only deal with EESPv0. If other EESP versions are
defined in future, their negotiation using IKEv2 should be covered by
separate documents.

EESP Security Associations (SAs) are negotiated in IKEv2 similarly
to ESP SAs - as Child SAs in the IKE_AUTH or the CREATE_CHILD_SA
exchanges. For this purpose a new Security Protocol Identifier EESPv0
(<TBD1>) is defined. This protocol identifier is placed in the
Protocol ID field of the Proposal Substructure in the SA Payload
when peers negotiate EESP version 0. It is possible for the initiator
to include both ESP and EESPv0 proposals in the SA
payload to negotiate either ESP or EESP.

** EESP Specific Transform Types and Transform IDs

*** Sub SA Key Derivation Function Transform

This document defines a new Sub SA Key Derivation Function (SSKDF)
transform type, that is used to negotiate a key derivation function
for Sub SAs as described in [[EESP Sub SA]].

This document creates a new IKEv2 IANA registry for the Key
Derivation Functions transform IDs. The initially defined Transform
IDs are listed in the table below.

#+caption: Sub SA Key Derivation Functions
| Value   | Algorithm           |
|---------+---------------------+
| 0       | NONE                |
| 1       | SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_256 |
| 2       | SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_384 |
| 3       | SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_512 |
| 4       | SSKDF_AES256_CMAC   |

These algorithms are defined as follows:

- SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_256, SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_384 and SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_512
  use HKDF-Expand defined in [[RFC5869]] with the indicated hash
  functions, that is, SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512, respectively, with
  corresponding key sizes of 32, 48 and 64 octets. SSKDF is then
  defined as:

  SSKDF(K, S, L) = HKDF-Expand(K, S, L)

- SSKDF_AES256_CMAC is currently undefined

Other key derivation functions may be added after the publication of
this document. Readers should refer to [[IKEv2-IANA]] for the latest
values.

The type of the Sub SA Key Derivation Function transform is <TBA2>.


*** New Transform IDs for Sequence Numbers Transform Type

This document defines two new Transform IDs for the Sequence Numbers
transform type: ~64-bit Sequential Numbers~ (<TBD4>) and ~None~ (<TBD5>).

To enable presence of sequence numbers in the EESP header the
initiator MUST propose SN = (64-bit Sequential Numbers) in the
Proposal Substructure inside the Security Association (SA) payload.
When the responder selects 64-bit Sequential Numbers, the Sequence Number
field is included into the EESP header, that allows peers to
achieve replay protection.

# NOTE STK: I'd say MUST above as we want to negotiate Anti-Replay
# service and not just the presense of the seq nr field.

To disable sequence numbering, and thus replay protection based on
sequence numbers, the initiator MUST propose SN=None (<TBD5>).
When the responder selects None, Sequence Number field is omitted
from the EESP header.

** Transforms Consistency

IKEv2 limits transform types that can appear in the Proposal
substructure based on its Protocol ID field (see Section 3.3.3 of
[[RFC7296]]). For EESPv0 the following transform types are allowed:

| Protocol | Mandatory Types  | Optional Types   |
|----------+------------------+------------------+
| EESPv0   | ENCR, SN         | KE, SSKDF        |

# [VS} I assume we want to only allow AEAD ciphers for EESP, thus no
# [VS] INTEG transforms are allowed? Or not?
For the ENCR transform type only those transform IDs that define use
of AEAD cipher mode are allowed in case of EESPv0.
Transform IDs that define pure encryption MUST NOT be used in the
context of EESPv0.

# [VS] Discussion: perhaps we should which ciphers among the
# [VS] currently registered are OK for use in EESP.
# [VS] The use of these transforms should be specified somewhere
# [VS] Currently all transforms are specified for ESP (and some for
# [VS] IKEv2). My understanding is that for EESP a separate document
# [VS] similar to RFC 4309, RFC 7634 etc. should be created. In
# [VS] particular, it must specify the AAD for EESP (which is
# [VS] different than for ESP) IV format and nonce calculation
# [VS] (these can be the same as for ESP).
# [VS] This can be done either in the core eesp document or in a
# [VS] separate draft, but not in this document,
# [VS] since this is not concerned with IKEv2.
# [VS] In addition, that document must request IANA to add a column
# [VS] "EESPv0 Reference" to the ENCR Transform IDs registry.

Note, that ~64-bit Sequential Numbers~ and ~None~ transform IDs are
unspecified for ESP and MUST NOT be used in ESP proposals.
On the other hand, currently defined transform IDs for the
Sequence Numbers transform type (32-bit Sequential Numbers and
Partially Transmitted 64-bit Sequential Numbers)
are unspecified for EESPv0 and MUST NOT be used in EESPv0 proposals.

Implemenattions MUST ignore transforms containing invalid
values for the current proposal (as if they are unrecognized,
in accordance with Section 3.3.6 of [[RFC7296]]).

The use of the None Transform ID for the SN transform
if further limited by the ENCR transform. In particular,
if the selected ENCR transform defines use of implicit IV
(as transforms defined in [[RFC8750]]), then the value None MUST NOT
be selected for the SN transform.

** Example of SA Payload Negotiating EESP

Below is the example of SA payload for EESP negotiation.

#+caption: EESPv0 SA proposal

#+end_src

** Use of Notifications in the Process of EESP Negotiation

IKEv2 Notify Message Status Type USE_WESP_MODE, [[RFC5840]], is not
supported when negotiating EESP SA, because the WESP functionality
is part of EESP protocol. If this notification is received it
MUST be ignored.

The ESP_TFC_PADDING_NOT_SUPPORTED, [[RFC7296]], notification is not
supported in EESP, instead use IP-TFS, USE_AGGFRAG, [[RFC9347]].
If this notification is received it MUST be ignored.

# [VS] I don't think this should be repeated. We've said that EESP
# [VS] SA is a Child SA, thus all mentioned in these sections
# [VS] applies automatically
# ** Negotiating an EESP SA using IKE_AUTH or CREATE_CHILD_SA
# To negotiate an EESP Child SA, use the IKEv2 IKE_AUTH or
# CREATE_CHILD_SA new SA exchange. The SA Payload, Proposal
# MUST have Security Protocol Identifier, Proto Id = EESP
# which is specified in [[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]],
# as specified in this document, and uses the
# EESP Transform attributes defined in [[EESP SA Transforms]].

# ** Rekeying an EESP SA with the CREATE_CHILD_SA Exchange
# Rekeying an EESP SA follows the same procedure as rekeying an ESP SA,
# as specified in Sections 1.3.3 and 2.8 of [[RFC7296]]. During the
# rekeying process, the [[EESP SA Transforms]] MUST remain identical to
# those negotiated when the SA was initially established.

# ** Deleting EESP SA with INFORMATIONAL Exchange

# EESP SA always exist in pairs. Deleting EESP SA follows the same
# procedure as deleting Child SA using IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange as
# specified in Section 1.4.1 [[RFC7296]]

# * EESP SA Transforms
# EESP introduces several transform properties that are negotiated
# during the establishment of an EESP SA. These properties MUST be
# identical for the duration of the SA. When the SA is rekeyed,
# the new SA MUST inherit all EESP transform properties negotiated for
# the original EESP SA.
#
# | Type | Description               | Used In | Reference       |
# |------+---------------------------+---------+-----------------+
# | TBD6 | EESP Session ID(EESPSID)  |  (EESP) | [this document] |

** Announcing Maximum Sub SA ID

In the process of establishing the EESP SA, each peer MAY inform the
other side about the maximum value of Sub SA ID that it can
accept as a receiver. The other side MUST choose IDs for its outgoing
Sub SAs in the range from zero to this value (inclusive). Thus,
announcing the maximum value for Sub SA ID effectively limits the
number of Sub SAs the sending side is ready to handle as a Sub SA
receiver.

Note that this is not a negotiation: each side can indicate its own
value for the maximum Sub SA ID. In addition, sending side is not
required to consume all possible Sub SA IDs up to the indicated
maximum value - it can create fewer Sub SAs. In any case, when
creating Sub SAs as a sender an endpoint has to consider that Sub SA
IDs MUST NOT repeat for a given EESP SA and MUST NOT exceed the value
sent by the peer in this notification. The actual number of Sub SAs
can be different in different directions.

A new notify status type EESP_MAX_SUB_SA_ID (<TBD3>) is defined by
this document. The format of the Notify payload for this notification
is shown below.

#+caption: Sub SA Notifier
#+name: sub-sa-notifier
#+begin_src
                    1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

+---------------+---------------+-------------------------------+
!      Maximum Sub SA ID        |
+-------------------------------+
#+end_src

# [VS] Why do we need a RESERVED field here?

- Protocol ID (1 octet) - MUST be 0. MUST be ignored if not 0.
- SPI Size (1 octet) - MUST be 0. MUST be ignored if not 0.
- Notify Status Message Type (2 octets) - set to EESP_MAX_SUB_SA_ID (<TBD3>).
# [VS] Why it is 16-bit and not 32-bit in size?
- Maximum Sub SA ID (2 octets, integer in network byte order)
  -- specifies the maximum value for the EESP Sub SA ID the
  sender of this notification is expecting to receive

The maximum number of Sub SAs the sender of this notification can
handle as a receiver can be calculated as the value of the Maximum
Sub SA ID field plus 1. For example, value 0 in the Maximum Sub SA ID
field means that only one Sub SA (with Subs SA ID = 0) can be
handled.

If a peer doesn't have any restrictions on the number of the incoming
Sub SAs, then it MAY omit sending this notification. As a consequence,
if this notification was not received by a peer, that peer can assume
that it can create as many outgoing Sub SAs as it needs (provided
that Sub SA IDs not repeat).

If no SSKDF transform was negotiated, this notification MUST be
ignored by peers.

* Key Derivation for Sub SAs

When an EESP SA is using Sub SAs, each Sub SA (including the one
with Session ID 0) uses separate keys. This allows each Sub SA to use
its own independent Sequence Number and IV space.

In order to derive these keys, a Sub SA Key Derivation Function
(SSKDF) MUST be negotiated as part of the proposal of the EESP SA
using Transform Type <TBD2>. This SSKDF is independent of the PRF
negotiated for IKEv2.

If no Sub SAs are to be used for an EESP SA, Transform Type <TBD2>
SHOULD be omitted in the proposal, but it MAY be NONE. If it's
omitted or NONE is selected by the responder, Sub SAs cannot be
created by either peer and the key derivation for the in- and
outbound EESP SAs of the Child SA are done as described in section
2.17 of [[RFC7296]].

If an SSKDF is selected as part of the proposal, instead of directly
taking keys for the Sub SAs from KEYMAT, as described in section 2.17
of [[RFC7296]], only one ~root~ key is taken for each EESP SA of the
Child SA. Their length is determined by the key size of the
negotiated SSKDF. The root key for the EESP SA carrying data from
the initiator to the responder is taken before that for the SA going
from the responder to the initiator.

The root key and SSKDF are configured as properties of an EESP SA,
which derives the keys for individual Sub SAs as specified in
[[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]].

Because individual Sub SAs can't be rekeyed, the complete EESP Child
SA MUST be rekeyed when either a cryptographic limit or a time-based
limit is reached for any individual Sub SA.

# [VS] I think this stuff should be in a separate document (or in
# [VS] the next versions)
# ** Multiple Sender Group SA Key Derivation
#
# When using EESP with a group SA, as specified in
# [[I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2]], the Sender-ID MUST be used for
# deriving a unique key for each sender. This ensures that each
# sender maintains a distinct IV and/or sequence number space.
# When using independent keys, the Implicit IV (IIV) transforms
# may be used.
#
# The Sender-ID is carried in each packet within the Session ID
# field, allowing efficient and reliable key differentiation for
# data security and integrity.
#
# The maximum length of GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS in GCKS policy
# is 16 bits when using the Session ID to carry the Sender-ID.
#
# [Note: we could allow 32 bit or any lenght field for
# GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS then it would have be carried in
# a EESP Options TLV and not in Session ID]

|  	 | Function (SSKDF)       |          |                 |

Valid Transform IDs are defined in a new registry listed in
[[tbl-sskdfids]].

This document also modifies the "Used In" column of existing
"Encryption Algorithm (ENCR)" transform type by adding EESPv0 as
allowed protocol for this transform and adding a rederence to this
document.

| <TBD3> | EESP_MAX_SUB_SA_ID         | [this document] |

# *** Extending ESP with EESP
#Several tables in [[IKEv2-IANA]] that specify ESP as protocol
#should be extended with EESP. Should we list each table one by one or
#specify as replace ESP, with ESP, EESP.e.g in the Transform Type Values,
#replace 'IKE and ESP' with 'IKE, ESP, and EESP'
#
#Changes the "Used In" column for the existing allocations as follows;

*** Sequence Number

This document defines two new values in the IKEv2 "Transform Type 5
- Sequence Numbers Properties Transform IDs" registry:

| Value   | Name                          | Reference       |
|---------+-------------------------------+-----------------+
| <TBD4>  | 64-bit Sequential Numbers     | [this document] |
| <TBD5>  | None                          | [this document] |

** New IKEv2 Registries

A new set of registries is created for EESP on IKEv2
parameters page [[IKEv2-IANA]]. The terms
Reserved, Expert Review and Private Use are to be applied as defined
in [[RFC8126]].

*** Transform Type <TBD2> - Sub SA Key Derivation Function Transform IDs

# what KDFs should we actually define here? more/less?
# SSKDF_AES256_CMAC is currently unspecified

This documents creates the new IKEv2 registry "Transform Type <TBD2> -
Sub SA Key Derivation Function Transform IDs". The initial values of
this registry are:

#+caption: "Transform Type <TBD2>" Registry
#+name: tbl-sskdfids
| Number  | Name                          | Reference       |
|---------+-------------------------------+-----------------+
| 0       | NONE                          | [this document] |
| 1       | SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_256           | [this document] |
| 2       | SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_384           | [this document] |
| 3       | SSKDF_HKDF_SHA2_512           | [this document] |
| 4       | SSKDF_AES256_CMAC             | [TBD]           |
| 5-1023  | Unassigned                    | [this document] |
| 1024-65535| Private use                 | [this document] |

Changes and additions to the unassigned range of this registry are
by the Expert Review Policy [[RFC8126]].

*** Guidance for Designated Experts

In all cases of Expert Review Policy described here,
the Designated Expert (DE) is expected to ascertain the existence of
suitable documentation (a specification) as described in [[RFC8126]]
and to verify that the document is permanently and publicly
available. The DE is also expected to check the clarity of purpose
and use of the requested code points. Last, the DE must verify that
any specification produced outside the IETF does not conflict with
work that is active or already published within the IETF.

* Implementation Status

[Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
[[RFC7942]] before publication.]

This section records the status of known implementations of the
protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [[RFC7942]].
The description of implementations in this section is intended to
assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort
has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not
be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
exist.

According to [[RFC7942]], "this will allow reviewers and working
groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit
of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this
information as they see fit".

Authors are requested to add a note to the RFC Editor at the top of
this section, advising the Editor to remove the entire section before
publication, as well as the reference to [[RFC7942]].


* Security Considerations

EESP option Crypt Offset [[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]] section [XXX]
allows exposing transport headers for telemetry.
It is indented use of within data center.

When an EESP receiver implementation uses Stateless Decryption, it
may not rely on single Security Policy Database (SPD) as specified in
the IPsec Architecture document [[RFC4301]], section 4.4.1. However,
the receiver MUST validate the negotiated Security Policy through
other means to ensure compliance with the intended security
requirements. For by adding Security Policy to the socket or route
entry. Also comply with ICMP processing specified in section 6 of
[[RFC4301]].

If the replay protection service is disabled, an attacker can
re-play packets with a different source address. Such an attacker
could disrupt the connection by replaying a single packet with a
different source address or port number.
In this case the receiver SHOULD NOT dynamically modify ports or
addresses without using IKEv2 Mobility [[RFC4555]].

Additional security relevant aspects of using the IPsec protocol are
discussed in the Security Architecture document [[RFC4301]].
