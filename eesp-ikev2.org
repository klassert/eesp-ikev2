* Introduction


The Enhanced Encapsulating Security Payload (EESP), specified in
[[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]], introduces enhancements to the
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) defined in [RFC4303]. These
improvements address evolving requirements in modern IPsec
deployments. EESP offers increased flexibility for hardware
offloads at the packet level. It supports carrying inner packet flow
identifiers for the use with ECMP, RSS hardware, and IPsec peers
prior to decryption. EESP also enables the establishment of Sub Child
SAs with independent sequence number spaces. Additionally, it
supports the use of 64-bit sequence numbers in each packet or the
omission of sequence numbers when the Replay Protection service is
disabled. EESP packets carry a version number, enabling easier
support for future extensions.

This document specifies the negotiation of EESP Security
Associations (SAs) within the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol [RFC7296]. It details the creation,
rekeying, and deletion of EESP SAs, as well as the negotiation of
EESP specific transform properties and properties.

The extensions defined here enable EESP SAs to coexist with ESP SAs
in stateful decryption configurations, sharing a common SPI namespace
while introducing new capabilities to enhance IPsecâ€™s performance
and versatility in modern use cases.

This document does not obsolete or update any existing RFCs. While
stateless implementations of EESP are referenced, their negotiation,
which is similar to [[PSP]], is outside the scope of this document.

** Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

** Terminology
It is assumed that readers are familiar with the IKEv2 negotiation
[[RFC7296]], IPsec architecture [[RFC4301]] and ESP [[RFC4303]].
This document uses a notation and conventions from IKEv2 [RFC7296]
to negotiate EESP.

This document uses the following terms defined in IKEv2 [[RFC7296]]:
Child SA, CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, IKE_AUTH exchange,
USE_TRANSPORT_MODE

This document uses the following terms defined in [[PSP]]: PSP (a
recursive acronym for PSP Security Protocol), Network Identifier
(VNI), Crypt Offset.

This document uses the following terms defined in [[RFC2992]]:
Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP)

This document uses the following terms defined in [[RFC4303]]:
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).

This document uses the following terms defined in
[[I-D.mrossberg-ipsecme-multiple-sequence-counters]]: Sub-Child SA.

This document uses the following terms defined in
[[I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-rename-esn]] : Replay Protection.

This document uses the following terms defined in

GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS, GCKS policy.

* EESP SA IKEv2 Negotiation
To negotiate of EESP Security Associations (SAs), as specified
in [[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]]. Propose ~Protocol ID~ EESP input
SA Payload, Proposal payload.
These extensions provide the ability to establish EESP SAs using
the IKE_AUTH or the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges. The initiator includes
EESP-specific transforms and attributes in the proposal, allowing
the responder to evaluate and establish the SA if supported.

IKEv2 Notify Message Status Type USE_WESP_MODE, [[RFC5840]], is not
supported when negotiating EESP SA. As the WESP functionality
is part of EESP protocol. If this notification is received it
MUST be discarded.

The ESP_TFC_PADDING_NOT_SUPPORTED, [[RFC7296]], notification is not
supported in EESP, instead use IP-TFS, USE_AGGFRAG, [[RFC9347]].
If this notification is received it MUST be discarded.

** Negotiating an EESP SA using IKE_AUTH or CREATE_CHILD_SA
To negotiate an EESP Child SA, use the IKEv2 IKE_AUTH or
CREATE_CHILD_SA new SA exchange. The SA Payload, Proposal
MUST have Security Protocol Identifier, Proto Id = EESP
which is specified in [[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]],
as specified in this document, and uses the
EESP Transform attributes defined in [[EESP SA Transforms]].

** Rekeying an EESP SA with the CREATE_CHILD_SA Exchange
Rekeying an EESP SA follows the same procedure as rekeying an ESP SA,
as specified in Sections 1.3.3 and 2.8 of [[RFC7296]]. During the
rekeying process, the [[EESP SA Transforms]] MUST remain identical to
those negotiated when the SA was initially established.

** Deleting EESP SA with INFORMATIONAL Exchange

EESP SA always exist in pairs. Deleting EESP SA follows the same
procedure as deleting Child SA using IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange as
specified in Section 1.4.1 [[RFC7296]]

* EESP SA Transforms
EESP introduces several transform properties that are negotiated
during the establishment of an EESP SA. These properties MUST be
identical for the duration of the SA. When the SA is rekeyed,
the new SA MUST inherit all EESP transform properties negotiated for
the original EESP SA.

#+end_src

** Replay Protection Service
EESP provides an optional Replay service using
Full 64 bit Sequence Numbers(TBD9), carried in the packet.
To enable Replay service the initiator SHOULD
propose Sequence Numbers Transforms,
SN = (Full 64 bit Sequence Number(TBD9)) in Substructure of the
Proposal Substructure inside the Security Association (SA) payload
in the IKEv2 Exchange. When the responder select Full 64 bit SN a
receiver MUST enable Reply Protection.

# NOTE STK: I'd say MUST above as we want to negotiate Anti-Replayservice
# and not just the presense of the seq nr field.

To disable sequence numbering, and thus replay protection based on
sequence numbers, the initiator MUST propose SN=None (TBD10). When the
sequence numbers are disabled, there won't be any SN in the
EESP packet, the receiver SHOULD NOT dynamically modify ports or
addresses without using IKEv2 Mobility [[RFC4555]].

Because the Replay Protection service is disabled, an attacker can re
play packets with a different source address. Such an attacker could
disrupt the connection by replaying a single packet with a different
source address or port number.

** Explicit Initialization Vector

If the algorithm used to encrypt the payload requires cryptographic
synchronization data, e.g., an Initialization Vector (IV), then this
may be carried explicitly in every EESP packet.

** Implicit Initialization Vectors

With the Implicit Initialization Vector (IIV) encryption algorithm,
as specified in [[RFC8750]], the IV MUST be omitted in the EESP
packet. To enable this functionality, IIV transforms defined in
[[IKEv2-Enc]] MUST be used during negotiation. Furthermore,
the [[IKEv2-SN]] extension MUST be negotiated to support the use of
a Full 64-bit Sequence Numbers in EESP packets. If the the proposal
does not include Full 64-bit Sequence Numbers return error
NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.

** EESP Version
Each SA need an EESP Base Header version which is specified
[[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]]. An Initiator may propose multipe
EESPV and the responder MUST choose one proposal.

** EESP Flow Identifier

EESP Flow Identifier (EESPFID) Options are used to carry
characteristic information of the inner flow and SHOULD NOT change on
per packet basis inside any inner flow to avoid packet reordering.
The Flow Identifier SHOULD be negotiated when creating EESP SA.


* Sub SAs

An EESP Sub SA is a unidirectional Security Association derived from
an existing EESP Child SA pair. It inherits all properties except
keys, sequence number space, and IV space. These three are unique for
each Sub SA. This allows finer granularity for managing
uni-directional traffic flows. Sub SAs avoid the overhead associated
with bidirectional Child SAs for identical traffic
selections[[RFC7296]], [[RFC9611]]. They enable more efficient
resource utilization and improved performance, particularly in
scenarios requiring high flexibility. Each Sub SA is uniquely
identified by a Sub SA ID, which is used to derive a unique key. The
Sub SA ID is carried in each EESP packet, either in the Session ID
field or in the Flow ID field, as negotiated during the establishment
of the EESP Child SA.

Advantages of Sub SAs compared to Child SAs with different keys:

- Possibility for unidirectional SAs. Compared to [[RFC9611]], when a
  per-resource SA is established, it is bidirectional. However, both
  directions of the SA MAY not always be in use. Using CREATE_CHILD_SA
  does not allow unidirectional SAs.

- No extra setup time, i.e., zero round-trip time to set up
  additional Sub SAs. This would be more efficient than using large
  IKE window size specified in [[RFC7296]] to manage multiple SAs.

- Sub SAs are more efficient to create, rekey, and delete. Their
lifecycle management is simpler compared to traditional Child SAs.

- When using hierarchical key derivation, especially when using
  hardware key derivation, Sub SA keys can be derived on-the-fly
  per packet. This reduces "Data-plane performance degradation due to
  the use of a larger number of keys" as noted in
  [[I-D.ponchon-ipsecme-anti-replay-subspaces]].

To negotiate Sub SA SUB_SA_ID in Session ID Transform. Or in a Flow
IDs Transform. TBD: expand Sub SA with Flow ID  negotiation

AEAD transforms, such as AES-GCM or those specified in [[RFC8750]],
require that the IV does not repeat within a single Sub SA. Each Sub
SA uses a distinct key, ensuring proper cryptographic separation.
While the IV may repeat across different Sub SAs, this complies with
the requirement that each key must be paired with a unique IV.

Each Sub SA MUST maintain an independent sequence number space
when using full 64-bit sequence numbers. For a specific key within
a Sub SA, sequence numbers MUST BE unique and follow a
monotonically increasing order to meet cryptographic requirements.

** UDP Encapsulation of Sub SA

An EESP SA primarily uses UDP encapsulation to facilitate NAT
traversal.  However, an additional use case for UDP encapsulation is
to introduce source port entropy, which supports ECMP or/and
RSS (Receive Side Scaling) mechanisms. In such scenarios, the
initiator MAY also use a distinct, ephemeral source port for
Sub SA IDs greater than zero. Both peers MAY independently select
different source ports for the same Sub SA ID.

It is important to note that IKE messages MUST NOT utilize these
ephemeral source ports. Instead, IKE traffic should be confined to
the source and destination ports to ensure proper protocol operation
and maintain compatibility with existing implementations.

When using ephemeral source ports, the receiver can only set the
source port upon arrival of an EESP packet with that Sub SA ID. If
the receiver is pre-populating a Sub SA, it may have to install it
with a source port set to zero and, upon arrival of a packet,
update the source port using a mapping change.

Additionally, when multiple Sub SAs exist, the receiver SHOULD
maintain a mapping table to track the source port associated with
each Sub SA independently. This ensures that traffic is correctly
routed and prevents ambiguity in handling packets associated with
different Sub SAs when a NAT is present.

** Key derivation for Sub SA

# [[RFC7296]] section 2.17 specifies Child SA key generation.

When the EESP SA is negotiated with a Sub SA Keys (SUB_SA_ID), each
Sub SA derives its own unique keys. This allows each Sub SA
its own independent Sequence Number space, and independent IV space.

The requirements:
- Independent keys for each Sub SA
- Ability to derive Sub SA keys on the fly with least amount of memory usage
- Minimal memory requirements
- Keyderviation support multiple SAs, such as EESP, AH
- Use the same Crypto primitive as used for encryption e.g. AES-*

*** Hierarchical key derivation
Hierarchical key derivation use Sub SA ID, which is carried in EESP
Seesion ID or in EESP Flow ID(TLV), as an input to the key dervivation.

Two KDF are propsed below and eventually choose one of them.

KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr | Sub SA ID)

Where Ni and Nr are the nonces from the IKE_SA_INIT exchange if this
request is the first Child SA created or the fresh Ni and Nr from the
CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange if this is a subsequent creation.

For CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges including an optional Key Exchange
the keying material is defined as:

KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, g^ir (new) | Ni | Nr | Sub SA ID)

where g^ir (new) is the shared secret from the ephemeral Key Exchange
of this CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange (represented as an
octet string in big endian order padded with zeros in the high-order
bits if necessary to make it the length of the modulus).

KEYMAT = prf+(prf(SK_d, Ni | Nr | Sub SA ID))

One advantage of Hierarchical KDF is KEYMAT for the Sub SAs can be
generated on the fly, for every packet, when available memory is
limited, for example [[PSP]]. This is usually the case when key
derivation is implemented in hardware. When implimenting in hardware
choose a hardware friendly prf+.

** Rekey Key Derivation.
During the EESP SA rekey, new keys are derived using the new Ni
and Nr values. If a Key Exchange (KE) method was used in the rekying,
CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, the new key MAY also include g^ir as part of
the derivation process.

KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr | Sub SA ID)

or

KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, g^ir (new) | Ni | Nr | Sub SA ID)

When there is an additionl Key Exchange in rekey.

Even though each Sub SA can be independently rekeyed, for
simplicity and security, all Sub SAs MUST be rekeyed together
when either a cryptographic limit or a time-based limit is
reached.

The time-based limit, also described in Section 2.8 of
[RFC7296], ensures periodic key replacement to minimize the risks
associated with long-term key exposure, even if the cryptographic
limit has not been reached.

When rekeying is triggered for any of the Sub SA by whichever
limitâ€”cryptographic or time- basedâ€”is reached first, subseqenty all
Sub SAs must rekeyed.


** Multiple Sender Group SA Key Derivation

When an EESP implementation uses a group SA with multiple senders,
as specified in [[I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2]], it MAY use the Sender-ID
to derive a unique key for each sender.  Using the Sender-ID ensures
that each sender maintains a distinct sequence number space and
initialization vector (IV). Implementations MAY also use
Implicit IV (IIV) transforms, [[RFC8750]] with independent sequence
number space.

Replay protection for multiple senders is only feasible when the
when sequence number space is independent for each senders.
If an implementation requires replay protection in a multi-sender
environment, it MUST use the Sender-ID Sub SA. The Sender-ID MUST
be carried in each packet within the Session ID field, providing
an efficient mechanism for key differentiation to protect data
confidentiality and integrity.

If the Session ID is used to carry the Sender-ID, the maximum length
of GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS in the GCKS policy MUST NOT exceed 16 bits.


** Multiple Sender Group SA Key Derivation

When an EESP implementation uses a group Security Association (SA)
with multiple senders, as specified in [[I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2]],
it MAY use the Sender-ID to derive a unique key for each sender.
If the Sender-ID is used for unique key derivation, each sender
would maintain a distinct Sequence Number space hence, distinct
initialization vector (IV). Also the implementations MAY use
Implicit IV (IIV) transforms for independent keys.

Replay protection for multiple senders is only feasible when the
Sender-ID is used and independent keys are derive. If an
implementation requires replay protection in a multi-sender
environment, it MUST use the Sender-ID.  The Sender-ID MUST be
carried in each packet within the Session ID field, thereby
providing an efficient and reliable mechanism for key
differentiation to protect data confidentiality and integrity.

If the Session ID is used to carry the Sender-ID, the maximum
length of GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS in the GCKS policy MUST NOT exceed
16 bits.

[Note: we could allow 32 bit or any length field for
GWP_SENDER_ID_BITS then it would have be carried in
a EESP Options TLV and not in Session ID. Should we
define a seperate TLV for the Group Sender ID?]

* Session ID

The Session ID is a multi-purpose attribute with mutually
exclusive values. The initiator MUST propose a single value in the
Child SA proposal, Transform EESPSSID (Value). The responder MUST
either accept the proposed value or reject it with an
INVALID_SESSION_ID error message, indicating a supported value.

* UDP Encapsulation for EESP

UDP encapsulation for EESP is largely similar to the ESP UDP
encapsulation specified in [[RFC3948]], with the primary difference
being the UDP source port used by the EESP Sub SA may be different
from IKE_SA source port, as specified in [[RFC3947]], for more
flexible handling of EESP traffic, particularly ECMP support
along the path and in the NIC.

A receiver indenting to support both ESP and EESP encapsulated in UDP
must start ESP  SPI, most significant bit of the SPI, with zero.

* EESP Crypt Offset Option
This option is typically used for within one Datacenter use case
such as [[PSP]]. To negotiate, the initiator sends USE_CRYPTOFFSET
together with USE_TRANSPORT_MODE and the responder respond with the
same. USE_EESP_CRYPTOFFSET is not supported in Tunnel mode or BEET
mode.
# Note STK:  This needs discussion
#
~NOTE~ Add EESP draft UDP section reference.

* Implementation Status

[Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
[[RFC7942]] before publication.]

This section records the status of known implementations of the
protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [[RFC7942]].
The description of implementations in this section is intended to
assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort
has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not
be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
exist.

According to [[RFC7942]], "this will allow reviewers and working
groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit
of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this
information as they see fit".

Authors are requested to add a note to the RFC Editor at the top of
this section, advising the Editor to remove the entire section before
publication, as well as the reference to [[RFC7942]].


* Security Considerations

EESP option Crypt Offset [[I-D.klassert-ipsecme-eesp]] section [XXX]
allows exposing transport headers for telemetry.
It is indented use of within data center.

When an EESP receiver implementation uses Stateless Decryption, it
may not rely on single Security Policy Database (SPD) as specified in
the IPsec Architecture document [[RFC4301]], section 4.4.1. However,
the receiver MUST validate the negotiated Security Policy through
other means to ensure compliance with the intended security
requirements. For by adding Security Policy to the socket or route
entry. Also comply with ICMP  processing specified  in section 6 of
RFC4301.

Additional security relevant aspects of using the IPsec protocol are
discussed in the Security Architecture document [[RFC4301]]
