* Introduction

These are notes on EESP IKEv2 and other EESP related information. To keep it in one place for quick access.

* KDF methods

IKEv2 key derivation, [[RFC7296]], is likely ~KDF in Feedback Mode~
specified in [[NIST800-108]] and [[RFC5869]]. This the iterative
method in Section 2.13 [[RFC7296]]

In the following, | indicates concatenation.  prf+ is defined as:
prf+ (K,S) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ...

where:
   T1 = prf (K, S | 0x01)

   T2 = prf (K, T1 | S | 0x02)

   T3 = prf (K, T2 | S | 0x03)

   T4 = prf (K, T3 | S | 0x04)

   ...

Section 2.14 of [[RFC7296]] which defined HMAC expansion of SKEYSEED

SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir)

IKEv2 key derivation has two setps. Above is the first step and next
key expansion using prf+.

{SK_d | SK_ai | SK_ar | SK_ei | SK_er | SK_pi | SK_pr}
                   = prf+ (SKEYSEED, Ni | Nr | SPIi | SPIr)

(indicating that the quantities SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei, SK_er,
SK_pi, and SK_pr are taken in order from the generated bits of the
prf+).  g^ir is the shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
exchange.  g^ir is represented as a string of octets in big endian
order padded with zeros if necessary to make it the length of the
modulus.  Ni and Nr are the nonces, stripped of any headers.

KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr)

Where Ni and Nr are the nonces from the IKE_SA_INIT exchange if this
request is the first Child SA created or the fresh Ni and Nr from the
CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange if this is a subsequent creation.

For CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges including an optional Diffie-Hellman
exchange, the keying material is defined as:

KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, g^ir (new) | Ni | Nr)

where g^ir (new) is the shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-
Hellman exchange of this CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange (represented as an
octet string in big endian order padded with zeros in the high-order
bits if necessary to make it the length of the modulus).

What EESP IKEv2 proposing as ~Heirarchial key derivation~
NIST800-108 defines ~Key Hierarchy~

In Section 5.4 of Key Management for Multicast [[RFC2627]] a
Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH). I din't follow that completly.
It is refered in G-IKEv2.

** Hardware friendly prf
Current IKEv2 IANA registry,[[IKEv2-prf]], specifies very few
hardware friendly Pseudorandom Function Transforms. And IETF
recmendations [[RFC8247]] has only PRF_AES128_XCBC.

Hardware friendly prf and prf+ are limited to maximum strength of
128 bits! While the SHA2 does not have this limit. This comes
from the limit of input and output block of AES underlying
structure. Input is 128 bit and output are 128bits,
even when using a 256 bit key. Hence the overall strength
when using AES as prf would reduce to 128bit.

In practice many cloud providers appears to be using more
hardware friendly PRF, such as AES-CMAC-128 by [[PSP]]
and very likely AES-CTR by Amazon AWS. Any public citations of AWS
PRF? I deduced AES-CTR from their comment to [[NIST-800-108-comments]].

Section 2.14 of [[RFC7296]] "If the negotiated PRF is
AES-XCBC-PRF-128 [[RFC4434]] or AES-CMAC-PRF-128 [[RFC4615]],
only the first 64 bits of Ni and the first 64 bits of Nr are used in
calculating SKEYSEED, but all the bits are used for input to the prf+
function." When using AES-XCBC-PRF-128 AES-CMAC-PRF-128 the SKEYSEED
will be 128bits long. It seems for that reason AES-CMAC-PRF-256 is not
standardized?

TLS 1.3, Appendix B of [[RFC8446]] lst HASH. It need a minimum 256
bit output, currently supports SHA256 and SHA384, a.k.a. HASH, HKDF.
e.g. TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.

** KDF  References

[[I-D.mattsson-cfrg-aes-gcm-sst]] seems to be deriving per packet keys
for GCM. This is an interesting work in cfrg and it is also proposed
to NIST. I think their work will keep the IKEv2 prf and prf+ as it is
just another layer of HKDF using the AEAD interface specified to
[[RFC5116]], which widely reffered API. So any existing implementation
that support RFC5116 would be compaitable with GCM SST proposal.
I only had qunck glance, so I am not 100% sure yet!

TLS 1.3[[RFC8446]] use hkdf and their reference
Krawczyk, H., "Cryptographic Extraction and Key Derivation: The HKDF
Scheme", Proceedings of CRYPTO 2010, August 2010,
<https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/264>.

IETF CFRG is working requirements of AEAD [[I-D.irtf-cfrg-aead-properties]]
They decided not discuss AEAD as PRF? This is sad news not to
specifiy use of same hardware primitive as a PRF for high performance
IPsec implimenation.

CFRG discusions point out ChaCha20oly1305 [[RFC7539]] is not a
PRF! This points to a reson when using  AEAD the underlying
crypto operation is used for XOF. Even when the tag 256 bit
AES output is  128bits. While there is also a suggestion
ChaCha20 is better that AES?

Discussion of  [[I-D.irtf-cfrg-aead-properties]]
https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?q=draft-irtf-cfrg-aead-properties%20PRF

Their argument is when using a 128bit primitive as PRF it's
estimated Birthday Attack strength is
128bits. Could this be fixed by using two rounds like PSP did and
concatinate it for prf, may be but this need be part of IKEv2. To propose
as part of section 2.14

Another possibly related work in cfrg, but for hardware wallets,
I.D-dijkhuis-cfrg-hdkeys

IPsecME discussion arguing AES based PRFs would have max 128bit entropy.
https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipsec/Tz4xsjmEHH57jvdMS9pqSFnGbwc/

NIST is coming up with a modern AEAD. The winner is [[ASCON]] in 2024.
The inventors envsions that AEAD as a PRF. However, only ASCON 128.
I found it odd this one only support 128 bit tags. Then we are back
to the same argument as this is not good enough for IKEv2 PRF.
May be because NIST called it light weight crypto:) We need one for
400Gbps too. A hardware NIC looks like an IoT.

* UDP Encap

Why UDP?
- For Roadwarrior: IPv4 home gateway.
- Why Datacenters, without NAT, using UDP? [Tero] This is a failure for a new protocol.
- In the Cloud per flow limitation, without NAT
- Wide spread RSS Support for UDP when using RFC9611

** Use cases for UDP Encapsulation  without NAT
*** UDP Encapsulation in Cloud Provider

A common question is why use UDP when there is no NAT, especially in
cloud environments or why vary UDP source ports for when using  multiple
SA such as [[RFC9681]]].

Cloud providers often enforce bandwidth limits per flow between nodes
or to external endpoints. A flow is defined by a 5-tuple: protocol,
local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. ESP (and likely
EESP) lacks port numbers, unlike UDP or TCP, so it is identified only
by its local and remote IPs. This causes ESP traffic to be treated as
one flow, leading to strict bandwidth limits.

These limits can severely impact IPsec throughput between peers,
especially when using [[RFC9611]].

A practical solution is to encapsulate ESP in UDP. By varying the UDP
source port based on inner flow characteristics, traffic can be spread
across multiple flows. This bypasses bandwidth restrictions and
improves throughput. Test results supporting this were presented in
[[AWS-IPsec-NetDev]].

* WESP UDP Encap
[[RFC5840]] WESP has the same issue, because they re-use destination
port 4500. WESP-in-UP add additoonal 32 bits, SPI 0x2, to disinguish
from EESP. It is 32 bits at the top. SPI 0x2 is from the reserved
range SPIs (0-255). I think, the RFC 5840 also advise not to use the
first nibble, 4 bits, numbers 4 and 6 could be used by IPv4 or IPv6.

#+end_src

EESP could use another spi say 3 as an EESP marker.
However, this 4 bytes would lead to waste of 4 bytes every EESP packet.

* UDP pot sharing on Linux

On Linux define EESPINUDP, a type socket encapsulation. It is
similar to ESPINUDP. When set this socket will accept IKE packets,
ESP or EESP packets. When sharing the same for port EESP and ESP
ESP SPI the bit 31 should be zero.
