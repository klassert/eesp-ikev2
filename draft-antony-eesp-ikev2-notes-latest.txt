1.  Introduction

   These are notes on EESP IKEv2 and other EESP related information.  To
   keep it in one place for quick access.

2.  KDF methods

   IKEv2 key derivation specified in [RFC7296] as prf+, is likely 'KDF
   in Feedback Mode' specified in [NIST800-108].  A prior step to the
   actual KDF, prf+, is a 'Randomness Extractor' step, which is prf in
   RFC7296.  The [RFC5869] This is a paper from the same auther
   [HKDF-paper] and talk from by Krawczyk [KDF-Lecture]

   IKEv2 prf+ the iterative method in Section 2.13 [RFC7296]

   In the following, | indicates concatenation.  prf+ is defined as:
   prf+ (K,S) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ...

   where: T1 = prf (K, S | 0x01)

   T2 = prf (K, T1 | S | 0x02)

   T3 = prf (K, T2 | S | 0x03)

   T4 = prf (K, T3 | S | 0x04)

   ...

   Section 2.14 of [RFC7296] which defined HMAC expansion of SKEYSEED

   SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir)

   IKEv2 key derivation has two setps.  Above is the first step and next
   key expansion using prf+.

   {SK_d | SK_ai | SK_ar | SK_ei | SK_er | SK_pi | SK_pr} = prf+
   (SKEYSEED, Ni | Nr | SPIi | SPIr)

   (indicating that the quantities SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei, SK_er,
   SK_pi, and SK_pr are taken in order from the generated bits of the
   prf+).  g^ir is the shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
   exchange.  g^ir is represented as a string of octets in big endian
   order padded with zeros if necessary to make it the length of the
   modulus.  Ni and Nr are the nonces, stripped of any headers.

   KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr)

   Where Ni and Nr are the nonces from the IKE_SA_INIT exchange if this
   request is the first Child SA created or the fresh Ni and Nr from the
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange if this is a subsequent creation.

   For CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges including an optional Diffie-Hellman
   exchange, the keying material is defined as:

   KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, g^ir (new) | Ni | Nr)

   where g^ir (new) is the shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman exchange of this CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange (represented as an
   octet string in big endian order padded with zeros in the high-order
   bits if necessary to make it the length of the modulus).

   What EESP IKEv2 proposing as 'Heirarchial key derivation' NIST800-108
   defines 'Key Hierarchy'

   In Section 5.4 of Key Management for Multicast [RFC2627] a Logical
   Key Hierarchy (LKH).  I din't follow that completly.  It is refered
   in G-IKEv2.

2.1.  KDF generic problem statement

   Fast KDF using AEAD, initial fcous on AES, primitives that can claim
   256 strength.

   Here is a longer problem statement.  The last part is out of my
   curiosity!

   Key Derivation Function (KDF) for Per-Packet Keys: Define a PSP-like
   KDF that can derive keys per packet at a rate of 200 million or more
   derivations per second?  This should support PSP-like, NIC master
   key, or IKEv2 SK_d as input.

   Sub-SA KDF for IKEv2 We need a KDF that fits the IKEv2 Child SA
   (using prf and prf+) model and can provide 256-bit strength, ideally
   on a per-packet basis.  We're also open to slower KDF options
   depending on the encryption algorithm.

Internet-Draft               KEv2 KDF Notes                February 2025


   Additional Questions: PSP chose AES-CMAC-256 as their KDF, but IETF
   doesn't define or mention it in RFC 8247.  Can we add AES-CMAC-256 to
   RFC 8247?

   Out of my curiosity: Are there any KDFs using AEAD that can claim
   256-bit strength?  I noticed even new ASCON limits itself to
   ASCON-128 when used as KDF/XOF/MAC.

2.2.  Hardware friendly prf

   Current IKEv2 IANA registry,[IKEv2-prf], specifies very few hardware
   friendly Pseudorandom Function Transforms.  And IETF recmendations
   [RFC8247] has only PRF_AES128_XCBC.

   Hardware friendly prf and prf+ are limited to maximum strength of 128
   bits!  While the SHA2 does not have this limit.  This comes from the
   limit of input and output block of AES underlying structure.  Input
   is 128 bit and output are 128bits, even when using a 256 bit key.
   Hence the overall strength when using AES as prf would reduce to
   128bit.

   In practice many cloud providers appears to be using more hardware
   friendly PRF, such as AES-CMAC-128 by [PSP] and very likely AES-CTR
   by Amazon AWS.  Any public citations of AWS PRF?  I deduced AES-CTR
   from their comment to [NIST-800-108-comments].

   Section 2.14 of [RFC7296] "If the negotiated PRF is AES-XCBC-PRF-128
   [RFC4434] or AES-CMAC-PRF-128 [RFC4615], only the first 64 bits of Ni
   and the first 64 bits of Nr are used in calculating SKEYSEED, but all
   the bits are used for input to the prf+ function."  When using AES-
   XCBC-PRF-128 AES-CMAC-PRF-128 the SKEYSEED will be 128bits long.  It
   seems for that reason AES-CMAC-PRF-256 is not standardized?

   TLS 1.3, Appendix B of [RFC8446] lst HASH.  It need a minimum 256 bit
   output, currently supports SHA256 and SHA384, a.k.a. HASH, HKDF. e.g.
   TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.

2.3.  KDF References

   Secure RTP KDF in [RFC6188] seems to be similar to our Sub SA.

   Sub SA KEYMAT = crypto(Sk_d, Sub SA Salt | Sub SA ID);

   e.g with AES-GCM: Sub SA KEYMAT = AES-CTR(Sk_d, Sub SA Salt | Sub SA
   ID);

   Where th Sub SA Salt is derived along with Sk_d to generate extra
   secret bytes?  Sub SA salt together with Sub SA ID would be 128 bits.

   [I-D.mattsson-cfrg-aes-gcm-sst] seems to be deriving per packet keys
   for GCM.  This is an interesting work in cfrg and it is also proposed
   to NIST.  I think their work will keep the IKEv2 prf and prf+ as it
   is just another layer of HKDF using the AEAD interface specified to
   [RFC5116], which widely reffered API.  So any existing implementation
   that support RFC5116 would be compaitable with GCM SST proposal.  I
   only had qunck glance, so I am not 100% sure yet!

   TLS 1.3[RFC8446] use hkdf and their reference Krawczyk, H.,
   "Cryptographic Extraction and Key Derivation: The HKDF Scheme",
   Proceedings of CRYPTO 2010, August 2010,
   https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/264.

   IETF CFRG is working requirements of AEAD
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-aead-properties] They decided not discuss AEAD as PRF?
   This is sad news not to specifiy use of same hardware primitive as a
   PRF for high performance IPsec implimenation.

   CFRG discusions point out ChaCha20oly1305 [RFC7539] is not a PRF!
   This points to a reson when using AEAD the underlying crypto
   operation is used for XOF.  Even when the tag 256 bit AES output is
   128bits.  While there is also a suggestion ChaCha20 is better that
   AES?

   Discussion of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-aead-properties]
   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?q=draft-irtf-cfrg-aead-
   properties%20PRF

   Their argument is when using a 128bit primitive as PRF it's estimated
   Birthday Attack strength is 128bits.  Could this be fixed by using
   two rounds like PSP did and concatinate it for prf, may be but this
   need be part of IKEv2.  To propose as part of section 2.14

   entropy. https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipsec/
   Tz4xsjmEHH57jvdMS9pqSFnGbwc/

   NIST is coming up with a modern AEAD.  The winner is [ASCON] in 2024.
   The inventors envsions that AEAD as a PRF.  However, only ASCON 128.
   I found it odd this one only support 128 bit tags.  Then we are back
   to the same argument as this is not good enough for IKEv2 PRF.  May
   be because NIST called it light weight crypto:) We need one for
   400Gbps too.  A hardware NIC looks like an IoT.

2.4.  Steffen's findings.

   Assume we use some KDF-AES-256 with AES blocksize of 128 bits.  Let
   K_in be the 256 bits input key of KDF-AES-256, n be some 128 bits
   plaintext and K_out the 128 bits derived session key such that

   KDF-AES-256(K_in, n) = K_out.

   Because the key space is 256 bits and plaintext/cipertext space is
   just 128 bits, the function KDF-AES-256 can't be bijective.  This
   means that there must be multiple keys K_in_i such that

   KDF-AES-256(K_in_i, n) = K_out.

   This means that you don't need to find K_in to break the session key
   K_out.  It is sufficiant to find one of the 'identical'keys K_in_i.

   Given keyspace of 256 bits and plaintext/cipertext of 128 bits, we
   have 2^256/2^128 = 2^128 'different' keys.

   So to find K_out, we just need to try 2^128 different keys, even
   though the keyspace is size is 2^256.

   This is why 256 bit keys have the same security level as 128 bit keys
   in this particular case.

   Unfortunately I had to figure that out myself, none of the documents
   that were written with that knowledge mentioned the problem.

   --- Actually, this is not quite right:

   Given keyspace of 256 bits and plaintext/cipertext of 128 bits, we
   have 2^256/2^128 = 2^128 'different' keys.

   It is so that:

   Given keyspace of 256 bits and plaintext/cipertext of 128 bits, we
   have 2^256/2^128 = 2^128 'identical' keys.

   But in this case 2^128 'identical' keys is the same as having 2^128
   'different' keys. ---

   I think this can be generalized.  If we have two pairs (n_j,K_out_j)
   such that:

   KDF-AES-256(K_in, n_1) = K_out_1 KDF-AES-256(K_in, n_2) = K_out_2

Internet-Draft               KEv2 KDF Notes                February 2025


   then we are back at a security level of 2^256.  I.e.  We have
   2^256/(2^128*2^128) =1 'identical' keys.  This would be the case if
   we want to generate a 256 bits key with counter mode.

   AA : for the cases where a Salt is required there would be a thrid
   call.  That third call would genearte the salt necessary.

3.  UDP Encap

   Why UDP?

   *  For Roadwarrior: IPv4 home gateway.

   *  Why Datacenters, without NAT, using UDP?  [Tero] This is a failure
      for a new protocol.

   *  In the Cloud per flow limitation, without NAT

   *  Wide spread RSS Support for UDP when using RFC9611

3.1.  UDP Encap Source port

   Current IKEv2 and ESP encapsulation in UDP are specified in [RFC3947]
   and [[RFC3948].  ESP can use the same port opened by IKE.  If look at
   Section 4 of [RFC3947] "The initiator MUST set both UDP source and
   destination ports to 4500."  This means IKE at the source CAN only
   use source port 4500.  HOwever, the RFC further allows inter mediate
   NAT gateways to change the source port from 4500 to X.  This causes
   split among IPsec adminstrators.

   IPsec adminstrators open only out going firewall on the peer for
   4500-4500.  While the incoming firewall is open for X:4500.

3.2.  Use cases for UDP Encapsulation without NAT

3.2.1.  UDP Encapsulation in Cloud Provider

   A common question is why use UDP when there is no NAT, especially in
   cloud environments or why vary UDP source ports for when using
   multiple SA such as [RFC9681]].

   Cloud providers often enforce bandwidth limits per flow between nodes
   or to external endpoints.  A flow is defined by a 5-tuple: protocol,
   local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port.  ESP (and likely
   EESP) lacks port numbers, unlike UDP or TCP, so it is identified only
   by its local and remote IPs.  This causes ESP traffic to be treated
   as one flow, leading to strict bandwidth limits.

   These limits can severely impact IPsec throughput between peers,
   especially when using [RFC9611].

   A practical solution is to encapsulate ESP in UDP.  By varying the
   UDP source port based on inner flow characteristics, traffic can be
   spread across multiple flows.  This bypasses bandwidth restrictions
   and improves throughput.  Test results supporting this were presented
   in [AWS-IPsec-NetDev].

   For further details, see: [Azure-Network], [AWS-Network],
   [GCP-Network], [I-D.bottorff-ipsecme-mtdcuc-ipsec-lb]

4.  WESP UDP Encap

   [RFC5840] WESP has the same issue, because they re-use destination
   port 4500.  WESP-in-UP add additoonal 32 bits, SPI 0x2, to disinguish
   from EESP.  It is 32 bits at the top.  SPI 0x2 is from the reserved
   range SPIs (0-255).  I think, the RFC 5840 also advise not to use the
   first nibble, 4 bits, numbers 4 and 6 could be used by IPv4 or IPv6.

5.  UDP pot sharing on Linux

   On Linux define EESPINUDP, a type socket encapsulation.  It is
   similar to ESPINUDP.  When set this socket will accept IKE packets,
   ESP or EESP packets.  When sharing the same for port EESP and ESP ESP
   SPI the bit 31 should be zero.
