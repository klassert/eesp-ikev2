1.  Introduction

   These are notes on EESP IKEv2 and other EESP related information.  To
   keep it in one place for quick access.

2.  KDF methods

   IKEv2 key derivation, [RFC7296], is likely 'KDF in Feedback Mode'
   specified in [NIST800-108].  This in iterative method as I see it in
   Section 2.13 [RFC7296]

   In the following, | indicates concatenation.  prf+ is defined as:
   prf+ (K,S) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ...

   where: T1 = prf (K, S | 0x01)

   T2 = prf (K, T1 | S | 0x02)

   T3 = prf (K, T2 | S | 0x03)

   T4 = prf (K, T3 | S | 0x04)

   ...

   Section 2.14 of [RFC7296]

   SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir)

   {SK_d | SK_ai | SK_ar | SK_ei | SK_er | SK_pi | SK_pr} = prf+
   (SKEYSEED, Ni | Nr | SPIi | SPIr)

   (indicating that the quantities SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei, SK_er,
   SK_pi, and SK_pr are taken in order from the generated bits of the
   prf+).  g^ir is the shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
   exchange.  g^ir is represented as a string of octets in big endian
   order padded with zeros if necessary to make it the length of the
   modulus.  Ni and Nr are the nonces, stripped of any headers.

   KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr)

   Where Ni and Nr are the nonces from the IKE_SA_INIT exchange if this
   request is the first Child SA created or the fresh Ni and Nr from the
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange if this is a subsequent creation.

   For CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges including an optional Diffie-Hellman
   exchange, the keying material is defined as:

   KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, g^ir (new) | Ni | Nr)

   where g^ir (new) is the shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman exchange of this CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange (represented as an
   octet string in big endian order padded with zeros in the high-order
   bits if necessary to make it the length of the modulus).

   What EESP IKEv2 proposing as 'Heirarchial key derivation' NIST800-108
   defines 'Key Hierarchy'

   In Section 5.4 of Key Management for Multicast [RFC2627] a Logical
   Key Hierarchy (LKH) . I din't follow that completly.  It is refered
   in G-IKEv2.

3.  UDP Encap

   Why UDP?

   *  For Roadwarrior: IPv4 home gateway.

   *  Why Datacenters, without NAT, using UDP?  [Tero] This is a failure
      for a new protocol.

   *  In the Cloud per flow limitation

3.1.  UDP Source Port issue

   2.1.  UDP-Encapsulated ESP Header Format [RFC3948] : "the Source Port
   and Destination Port MUST be the same as that used by IKE traffic "

   And [RFC3947] for IKE in UDP encapsulation: "The initiator MUST set
   both UDP source and destination ports to 4500."  However, NAT
   gateways the middleboxes, NAT gateways, are allowed to change source
   port number.  The receiver must accept any source port.  And the
   receiver MUST respond to the source port.  With this I.D.  We propose
   sender may also use non 4500 source port especially when using Sub
   SA, for per CPU SA.

3.2.  UDP Encap issue

   If the existing destination port 4500 is reused the packet the
   receiver must able to distingish ESP vs EESP.  If the EESP start with
   SPI this issue would not be there.  Otherwise like WESP encap we may
   have to add additionl 32 bits and reserve an ESP SPI bellow 255.

4.  WESP UDP Encap

   [RFC5840] WESP has the same issue, because they re-use destination
   port 4500.  WESP-in-UP add additoonal 32 bit, SPI 0x2 to disinguish
   from EESP.  It is 32 bits at the top.  SPI 0x2 is from the reserved
   range.  I think they say not use the first nibble, 4 bits, numbers 4
   and 6 could be used by IPv4 or IPv6.

   However, this 4 bytes would lead to waste of 4 bytes every EESP
   packet.
