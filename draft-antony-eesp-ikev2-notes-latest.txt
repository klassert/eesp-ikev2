1.  Introduction

   These are notes on EESP IKEv2 and other EESP related information.  To
   keep it in one place for quick access.

2.  KDF methods

   IKEv2 key derivation, [RFC7296], is likely 'KDF in Feedback Mode'
   specified in [NIST800-108].  This in iterative method as I see it in
   Section 2.13 [RFC7296]

   In the following, | indicates concatenation.  prf+ is defined as:
   prf+ (K,S) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ...

   where: T1 = prf (K, S | 0x01)

   T2 = prf (K, T1 | S | 0x02)

   T3 = prf (K, T2 | S | 0x03)

   T4 = prf (K, T3 | S | 0x04)

   ...

   Section 2.14 of [RFC7296]

   SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir)

   {SK_d | SK_ai | SK_ar | SK_ei | SK_er | SK_pi | SK_pr} = prf+
   (SKEYSEED, Ni | Nr | SPIi | SPIr)

   (indicating that the quantities SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei, SK_er,
   SK_pi, and SK_pr are taken in order from the generated bits of the
   prf+).  g^ir is the shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
   exchange.  g^ir is represented as a string of octets in big endian
   order padded with zeros if necessary to make it the length of the
   modulus.  Ni and Nr are the nonces, stripped of any headers.

   KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr)

   Where Ni and Nr are the nonces from the IKE_SA_INIT exchange if this
   request is the first Child SA created or the fresh Ni and Nr from the
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange if this is a subsequent creation.

   For CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges including an optional Diffie-Hellman
   exchange, the keying material is defined as:

   KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, g^ir (new) | Ni | Nr)

   where g^ir (new) is the shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman exchange of this CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange (represented as an
   octet string in big endian order padded with zeros in the high-order
   bits if necessary to make it the length of the modulus).

   What EESP IKEv2 proposing as 'Heirarchial key derivation' NIST800-108
   defines 'Key Hierarchy'

   In Section 5.4 of Key Management for Multicast [RFC2627] a Logical
   Key Hierarchy (LKH) . I din't follow that completly.  It is refered
   in G-IKEv2.

3.  UDP Encap

   Why UDP?

   *  For Roadwarrior: IPv4 home gateway.

   *  Why Datacenters, without NAT, using UDP?  [Tero] This is a failure
      for a new protocol.

   *  In the Cloud per flow limitation, without NAT

   *  Wide spread RSS Support for UDP when using RFC9611

3.1.  Use cases for UDP Encapsulation without NAT

3.1.1.  UDP Encapsulation in Cloud Provider

   A common question is why use UDP when there is no NAT, especially in
   cloud environments or why vary UDP source ports for inner flows.

   Cloud providers often enforce bandwidth limits per flow between nodes
   or to external endpoints.  A flow is defined by a 5-tuple: protocol,
   local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port.  ESP (and likely
   EESP) lacks port numbers, unlike UDP or TCP, so it is identified only
   by its local and remote IPs.  This causes ESP traffic to be treated
   as one flow, leading to strict bandwidth limits.

   These limits can severely impact IPsec throughput between peers,
   especially when using [RFC9611].

   A practical solution is to encapsulate ESP in UDP.  By varying the
   UDP source port based on inner flow characteristics, traffic can be
   spread across multiple flows.  This bypasses bandwidth restrictions
   and improves throughput.  Test results supporting this were presented
   in [AWS-IPsec-NetDev].

4.  WESP UDP Encap

   [RFC5840] WESP has the same issue, because they re-use destination
   port 4500.  WESP-in-UP add additoonal 32 bits, SPI 0x2, to disinguish
   from EESP.  It is 32 bits at the top.  SPI 0x2 is from the reserved
   range SPIs (0-255).  I think, the RFC 5840 also advise not to use the
   first nibble, 4 bits, numbers 4 and 6 could be used by IPv4 or IPv6.

   |                                                               |

              Figure 1: Figure 4: UDP-Encapsulated WESP Header

   EESP could use another spi say 3 as an EESP marker.  However, this 4
   bytes would lead to waste of 4 bytes every EESP packet.
